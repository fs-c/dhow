# Dhow

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dhow) ![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/dhow)

JSX-powered SSG for Node.js. Write logic like React with a directory-structure like Next.js but generate plain HTML with no client side JS.

## Getting Started

Getting started is very simple. You can use the [`create-dhow-app`](https://github.com/kartiknair/create-dhow-app) npm package to quickly bootstrap a project based on a template.

```shell
npx create-dhow-app my-app # Optionally specify a template like this: `--template blog`

# For older versions of npm
npm i -g create-dhow-app
create-dhow-app my-app
```

The default template will show you the basic structure of a Dhow app but using something like the blog template will show you everything Dhow can offer.

### Create a project from scratch

If you would like you can also create a project from scratch without using `create-dhow-app`. Let's walk through it.

```shell
# make a directory for your project
mkdir my-app

# change your directory
cd my-app

# initialize npm (optionally using `-y`)
npm init -y

# install dhow
npm i dhow

# create a `src/pages` directory
mkdir src && cd src && mkdir pages
```

Once you're at this point add a few `.js` files to the `src/pages` directory. After that we can set up our scripts in `package.json`. We're gonna add two scripts `dev` to start the Dhow dev server & `build` to build the files a single time. Also I'm going to set the `type` to `module` so we can use ES Modules syntax.

```diff
{
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Basic example using Dhow as a Static Site Generator",
    "main": "index.js",
+    "scripts": {
+        "dev": "dhow -w",
+        "build": "dhow"
+    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "MIT",
    "dependencies": {
        "dhow": "^1.2.1"
    },
+    "type": "module"
}
```

## CSS Files

Dhow uses [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) under the hood to process all your CSS files. This means you can create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your directory, and Dhow will use the plugins you use in that file (you can see this in the [TailwindCSS example](https://github.com/kartiknair/dhow/tree/master/examples/tailwind)).

> Note: Dhow unlike some bundlers (like Parcel) uses **no plugins by default**

## What it does

Dhow is basically a transpiler. It takes a `.js` file like this:

```jsx
import Dhow from 'dhow'

const Home = () => (
    <main>
        <h3>This is my home</h3>
        <p>On the internet obviously</p>
    </main>
)

export const Head = () => (
    <>
        <title>Home page</title>
    </>
)

export default Home
```

and converts it into a static HTML file like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Home page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="dhow">
            <main>
                <h3>This is my home</h3>
                <p>On the internet obviously</p>
            </main>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can also export an (optionally) async `getProps` function from your file to fetch data. This will be run during build time & the props that it returns will be passed to your `Head` component & default component.

```jsx
import Dhow from 'dhow'
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

const Home = ({ posts }) => (
    <main>
        <h1>All the blog posts</h1>
        <ul>
            {posts.map((post) => (
                <li>
                    <h3>{post.title}</h3>
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    </main>
)

export const Head = () => (
    <>
        <title>Blog Posts</title>
    </>
)

export const getProps = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
    const data = await res.json()
    return { posts: data }
}

export default Home
```

To generate multiple files using a single `.js` file you can export an (optionally) async `getPaths` function from your file. It should return an array of strings. Each of them will replace your filename in the end result. Each of the paths will also be passed to your `getProps` function if you do export one.

```jsx
import Dhow from 'dhow'
import { readFile, readdir } from 'fs/promises'
import { join } from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import marked from 'marked'

const Post = ({
    post: {
        content,
        data: { title, date, description },
    },
}) => (
    <article>
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <p>
            <small>{new Date(date).toDateString()}</small>
        </p>
        <p>{description}</p>
        <h4>â€•</h4>
        <div html={content}></div>
    </article>
)

export const Head = ({
    post: {
        data: { title, description },
    },
}) => (
    <>
        <title>{title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={description} />
    </>
)

export const getPaths = async () => {
    const files = await readdir('./content')
    return files.map((path) => path.slice(0, path.length - 3))
}

export const getProps = async (slug) => {
    let post = await readFile(join('./content', `${slug}.md`), 'utf-8')
    post = matter(post)
    post.content = marked(post.content)
    return { post }
}

export default Post
```

## How it works

Behind the scenes Dhow is actually pretty simple, it uses [`min-document`](https://github.com/Raynos/min-document) & [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) to create fake DOM nodes from your JSX.

As a CLI tool Dhow takes `.js` files from your `src/pages` directory & uses esbuild to compile it into non-JSX. Then it calls your default export function and appends the element it returns to a `.dhow` div in the document. If you do export a `Head` function then the contents of that are added to the `<head>` of the document. Then the `outerHTML` of this document is saved into an `html` file corresponding to the path of your source file.

If you export a `getProps` function then the results of that function are passed to your default & `Head` component. If you export a `getPaths` function then the same file is evalauated once for each path. Each path is also passed to `getProps` (if it exists) so you can fetch path specific data. While it is not necessary you can use square brackets around the name of a file that exports a `getPaths` function to remain true to Next.js (e.g `[fileName].js`)
